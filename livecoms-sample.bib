Therefore, precision medicine approaches based on the personal genomic background provide promising strategies to enhance the effectiveness of molecular-targeted therapies. However, identifying drug resistance mutations in individuals by combining DNA sequencing and in vitro analyses is generally time consuming and costly. In contrast, in silico computation of protein-drug binding free energies allows for the rapid prediction of drug sensitivity changes associated with specific genetic mutations. Although conventional alchemical free energy computation methods have been used to quantify mutation-induced drug sensitivity changes in some protein targets, these methods are often adversely affected by free energy convergence. In this paper, we demonstrate significant improvements in prediction performance and free energy convergence by employing an alchemical mutation protocol, MutationFEP, which directly estimates binding free energy differences associated with protein mutations in three types of a protein and drug system. The superior performance of MutationFEP appears to be attributable to its more-moderate perturbation scheme. Therefore, this study provides a deeper level of insight into computer-assisted precision medicine.},

  abstract = {Binding affinities of cofactor and ligands to the active site of two different isoforms of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), heart and skeletal muscles (H4 and M4, respectively), can be used for medical and biological applications. Herein, a hybrid QM/MM computational approach based on free energy perturbation methods has been carried out to estimate binding affinities and binding isotope effects (BIEs) for NADH/NAD+ and oxamate, pyruvate, L-lactate, and D-lactate ligands to the M4 and H4 isoforms of L-LDH. Here, we show that determining how cofactor and ligands interact with the active site of LDH isoforms advanced the still open discussion on the intracellular lactate shuttle hypothesis. In our discussion we deny the key concept of this hypothesis showing, based on interaction energy values, that there is no evidence that the M4 type of LDH in the skeletal muscles cells served as a catalyst of the conversion of lactate to pyruvate. Additionally, theoretical determination of BIEs for H4 and M4 types of LDH shows that there is a way of using the BIEs as a tool capable to distinguish these isoforms, and for this purpose D-lactate labeled with deuterium in positions 11 or 7, 8, 9 ([11-2H]-BIE and [7,8,9-2H3]-BIE) or L-lactate labeled only in position 11 ([11-2H]-BIE) could be used. We propose the BIEs as a useful tool which can be applied in order to experimentally determine the types of LDH.},

  abstract = {Herein we provide high-precision validation tests of the latest GPU-accelerated free energy code in AMBER. We demonstrate that consistent free energy results are obtained in both the gas phase and in solution. We first show, in the context of thermodynamic integration (TI), that the results are invariant with respect to ``split'' (e.g., stepwise decharge\textendash vdW\textendash recharge) versus ``unified'' protocols. This brought to light a subtle inconsistency in previous versions of AMBER that was traced to the improper treatment of 1\textendash 4 vdW and electrostatic interactions involving atoms across the softcore boundary. We illustrate that under the assumption that the ensembles produced by different legs of the alchemical transformation between molecules A and B in the gas phase and aqueous phase are very small, the inconsistency in the relative hydration free energy {$\Delta\Delta$}Ghydr[A \textrightarrow{} B] = {$\Delta$}Gaq[A \textrightarrow{} B] \textendash{} {$\Delta$}Ggas[A \textrightarrow{} B] is minimal. However, for general cases where the ensembles are shown to be substantially different, as expected in ligand\textendash protein binding applications, these errors can be large. Finally, we demonstrate that results for relative hydration free energy simulations are independent of TI or multistate Bennett's acceptance ratio (MBAR) analysis, invariant to the specific choice of the softcore region, and in agreement with results derived from absolute hydration free energy values.},

To interpret results of such simulations appropriately, the quality of the calculated properties must be evaluated. This depends on the way the simulations are performed and on the way they are validated by comparison to values Qexp of experimentally observable quantities Q. One must consider 1) the accuracy of Qexp, 2) the accuracy of the function Q(rN) used to calculate a Q-value based on a molecular configuration rN of N particles, 3) the sensitivity of the function Q(rN) to the configuration rN, 4) the relative time scales of the simulation and experiment, 5) the degree to which the calculated and experimental properties are equivalent, and 6) the degree to which the system simulated matches the experimental conditions. Experimental data is limited in scope and generally corresponds to averages over both time and space. A critical analysis of the various factors influencing the apparent degree of (dis)agreement between simulations and experiment is presented and illustrated using examples from the literature. What can be done to enhance the validation of molecular simulation is also discussed.},

  abstract = {Relative ligand binding affinity calculations based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and non-physical (alchemical) thermodynamic cycles have shown great promise for structure-based drug design.           ,                             Ligand binding affinity calculations based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and non-physical (alchemical) thermodynamic cycles have shown great promise for structure-based drug design. However, their broad uptake and impact is held back by the notoriously complex setup of the calculations. Only a few tools other than the free energy perturbation approach by Schr\"odinger Inc. (referred to as FEP+) currently enable end-to-end application. Here, we present for the first time an approach based on the open-source software pmx that allows to easily set up and run alchemical calculations for diverse sets of small molecules using the GROMACS MD engine. The method relies on theoretically rigorous non-equilibrium thermodynamic integration (TI) foundations, and its flexibility allows calculations with multiple force fields. In this study, results from the Amber and Charmm force fields were combined to yield a consensus outcome performing on par with the commercial FEP+ approach. A large dataset of 482 perturbations from 13 different protein\textendash ligand datasets led to an average unsigned error (AUE) of 3.64 {$\pm$} 0.14 kJ mol               -1               , equivalent to Schr\"odinger's FEP+ AUE of 3.66 {$\pm$} 0.14 kJ mol               -1               . For the first time, a setup is presented for overall high precision and high accuracy relative protein\textendash ligand alchemical free energy calculations based on open-source software.},

  abstract = {More than 90\% of clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC) exhibit inactivation of the von Hippel\textendash Lindau (pVHL) tumor suppressor, establishing it as the major underlying cause of this malignancy. pVHL inactivation results in stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors, HIF1{$\alpha$} and HIF2{$\alpha$}, leading to expression of a genetic program essential for the initiation and progression of ccRCC. Herein, we describe the potent, selective, and orally active small-molecule inhibitor PT2385 as a specific antagonist of HIF2{$\alpha$} that allosterically blocks its dimerization with the HIF1{$\alpha$}/2{$\alpha$} transcriptional dimerization partner ARNT/HIF1{$\beta$}. PT2385 inhibited the expression of HIF2{$\alpha$}-dependent genes, including VEGF-A, PAI-1, and cyclin D1 in ccRCC cell lines and tumor xenografts. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with PT2385 caused dramatic tumor regressions, validating HIF2{$\alpha$} as a pivotal oncogenic driver in ccRCC. Notably, unlike other anticancer agents that inhibit VEGF receptor signaling, PT2385 exhibited no adverse effect on cardiovascular performance. Thus, PT2385 represents a novel class of therapeutics for the treatment of RCC with potent preclincal efficacy as well as improved tolerability relative to current agents that target the VEGF pathway.

  abstract = {Recent advances in improved force fields and sampling methods have made it possible for the accurate calculation of protein\textendash ligand binding free energies. Alchemical free energy perturbation (FEP) using an explicit solvent model is one of the most rigorous methods to calculate relative binding free energies. However, for cases where there are high energy barriers separating the relevant conformations that are important for ligand binding, the calculated free energy may depend on the initial conformation used in the simulation due to the lack of complete sampling of all the important regions in phase space. This is particularly true for ligands with multiple possible binding modes separated by high energy barriers, making it difficult to sample all relevant binding modes even with modern enhanced sampling methods. In this paper, we apply a previously developed method that provides a corrected binding free energy for ligands with multiple binding modes by combining the free energy results from multiple alchemical FEP calculations starting from all enumerated poses, and the results are compared with Glide docking and MM-GBSA calculations. From these calculations, the dominant ligand binding mode can also be predicted. We apply this method to a series of ligands that bind to c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1 (JNK1) and obtain improved free energy results. The dominant ligand binding modes predicted by this method agree with the available crystallography, while both Glide docking and MM-GBSA calculations incorrectly predict the binding modes for some ligands. The method also helps separate the force field error from the ligand sampling error, such that deviations in the predicted binding free energy from the experimental values likely indicate possible inaccuracies in the force field. An error in the force field for a subset of the ligands studied was identified using this method, and improved free energy results were obtained by correcting the partial charges assigned to the ligands. This improved the root-mean-square error (RMSE) for the predicted binding free energy from 1.9 kcal/mol with the original partial charges to 1.3 kcal/mol with the corrected partial charges.},

Despite the advantage of numerous targets allowing for broad hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype coverage, the only host target inhibitors that advanced into clinical development were Cyclosporin A based cyclophilin inhibitors. While cyclosporin-based molecules typically require a fermentation process, Gilead successfully pursued a fully synthetic, oral program based on Sanglifehrin A. The drug discovery process, though greatly helped by facile crystallography, was still hampered by the limitations in the accuracy of predictive computational methods for prioritizing compound ideas. Recent advances in accuracy and speed of free energy perturbation (FEP) methods, however, are attractive for prioritizing and derisking synthetically challenging molecules and potentially could have had a significant impact on the speed of the development of this program. Here in our simulated prospective study, the binding free energies of 26 macrocyclic cyclophilin inhibitors were blindly predicted using FEP+ to test this hypothesis. The predictions had a low mean unsigned error (MUE) (1.1 kcal/mol) and accurately reproduced many design decisions from the program, suggesting that FEP+ has the potential to drive synthetic chemistry efforts by more accurately ranking compounds with nonintuitive structure\textendash activity relationships (SARs).},

  abstract = {Macrocycles have been emerging as a very important drug class in the past few decades largely due to their expanded chemical diversity benefiting from advances in synthetic methods. Macrocyclization has been recognized as an effective way to restrict the conformational space of acyclic small molecule inhibitors with the hope of improving potency, selectivity, and metabolic stability. Because of their relatively larger size as compared to typical small molecule drugs and the complexity of the structures, efficient sampling of the accessible macrocycle conformational space and accurate prediction of their binding affinities to their target protein receptors poses a great challenge of central importance in computational macrocycle drug design. In this article, we present a novel method for relative binding free energy calculations between macrocycles with different ring sizes and between the macrocycles and their corresponding acyclic counterparts. We have applied the method to seven pharmaceutically interesting data sets taken from recent drug discovery projects including 33 macrocyclic ligands covering a diverse chemical space. The predicted binding free energies are in good agreement with experimental data with an overall root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.94 kcal/mol. This is to our knowledge the first time where the free energy of the macrocyclization of linear molecules has been directly calculated with rigorous physics-based free energy calculation methods, and we anticipate the outstanding accuracy demonstrated here across a broad range of target classes may have significant implications for macrocycle drug discovery.},

Most FEP packages use molecular dynamics (MD) to sample the configurations of proteins and ligands, as MD is well-suited to capturing coupled motion. However, MD can be prohibitively inefficient at sampling water molecules that are buried within binding sites, which has severely limited the domain of applicability of FEP and its prospective usage in drug discovery. In this paper, we present an advancement of FEP that augments MD with grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC), an enhanced sampling method, to overcome the problem of sampling water. We accomplished this without degrading computational performance. On both old and newly assembled data sets of protein\textendash ligand complexes, we show that the use of GCMC in FEP is essential for accurate and robust predictions for ligand perturbations that disrupt buried water.},

Herein, we propose a modified version of the FEP/REST (i.e., replica exchange with solute tempering) sampling protocol, based on detail studies on several targets by probing a large number of perturbations with different sampling schemes. Improved FEP+ binding affinity predictions for regular flexible-loop motions and considerable structural changes can be obtained by extending the prior to REST (pre-REST) sampling time from 0.24\,ns/{$\lambda$} to 5\,ns/{$\lambda$} and 2\,\texttimes\,10\,ns/{$\lambda$}, respectively. With this new protocol, much more precise {$\increment\increment$}G values of the individual perturbations, including the sign of the transformations and decreased error were obtained. We extended the REST simulations from 5\,ns to 8\,ns to achieve reasonable free energy convergence. Implementing REST to the entire ligand as opposed to solely the perturbed region, and also some important flexible protein residues (pREST region) in the ligand binding domain (LBD) has considerably improved the FEP+ results in most of the studied cases. Preliminary molecular dynamics (MD) runs were useful for establishing the correct binding mode of the compounds and thus precise alignment for FEP+\,. Our improved protocol may further increase the FEP+ accuracy.},

In this work, we performed free-energy calculations to study the thermodynamic properties of different states of molecular systems in their equilibrium basin, and obtained accurate absolute binding free-energy calculations for protein-ligand binding using a newly developed M2 algorithm. We used a range of Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG)-in/out p38{$\alpha$} mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors as our test cases. We also focused on the flexible DFG motif, which is closely connected to kinase activation and inhibitor binding. Our calculations explain the coexistence of DFG-in and DFG-out states of the loop and reveal different components (e.g., configurational entropy and enthalpy) that stabilize the apo p38{$\alpha$} conformations. To study novel ligand-binding modes and the key driving forces behind them, we computed the absolute binding free energies of 30 p38{$\alpha$} inhibitors, including analogs with unavailable experimental structures. The calculations revealed multiple stable, complex conformations and changes in p38{$\alpha$} and inhibitor conformations, as well as balance in several energetic terms and configurational entropy loss. The results provide relevant physics that can aid in designing inhibitors and understanding protein conformational equilibrium. Our approach is fast for use with proteins that contain flexible regions for structure-based drug design.},

  abstract = {Reliable prediction of binding affinities for ligand-receptor complex has been the primary goal of a structure-based drug design process. In this respect, alchemical methods are evolving as a popular choice to predict the binding affinities for biomolecular complexes. However, the highly flexible protein-ligand systems pose a challenge to the accuracy of binding free energy calculations mostly due to insufficient sampling. Herein, integrated computational protocol combining free energy perturbation based absolute binding free energy calculation with free energy landscape method was proposed for improved prediction of binding free energy for flexible protein-ligand complexes. The proposed method is applied to the dataset of various classes of p53-MDM2 (murine double minute 2) inhibitors. The absolute binding free energy calculations for MDMX (murine double minute X) resulted in a mean absolute error value of 0.816 kcal/mol while it is 3.08 kcal/mol for MDM2, a highly flexible protein compared to MDMX. With the integration of the free energy landscape method, the mean absolute error for MDM2 is improved to 1.95 kcal/mol.},

  abstract = {A strategy in drug design is to consider enhancing the affinity of lead molecules with structural modifications that displace water molecules from a protein binding site. Because success of the approach is uncertain, clarification of the associated energetics was sought in cases where similar structural modifications yield qualitatively different outcomes. Specifically, free-energy perturbation calculations were carried out in the context of Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations to investigate ligand series that feature displacement of ordered water molecules in the binding sites of scytalone dehydratase, p38-{$\alpha$}MAP kinase, and EGFR kinase. The change in affinity for a ligand modification is found to correlate with the ease of displacement of the ordered water molecule. However, as in the EGFR example, the binding affinity may diminish if the free-energy increase due to the removal of the bound water molecule is not more than compensated by the additional interactions of the water-displacing moiety. For accurate computation of the effects of ligand modifications, a complete thermodynamic analysis is shown to be needed. It requires identification of the location of water molecules in the protein-ligand interface and evaluation of the free-energy changes associated with their removal and with the introduction of the ligand modification. Direct modification of the ligand in free-energy calculations is likely to trap the ordered molecule and provide misleading guidance for lead optimization.},

  abstract = {Computational methods to calculate ligand binding affinities are increasing in popularity, due to improvements in simulation algorithms, computational resources, and easy-to-use software. However, issues can arise in relative ligand binding free energy simulations if the ligands considered have different active site water networks, as simulations are typically performed with a predetermined number of water molecules (fixed N ensembles) in preassigned locations. If an alchemical perturbation is attempted where the change should result in a different active site water network, the water molecules may not be able to adapt appropriately within the time scales of the simulations\textemdash particularly if the active site is occluded. By combining the grand canonical ensemble ({$\mu$}VT) to sample active site water molecules, with conventional alchemical free energy methods, the water network is able to dynamically adapt to the changing ligand. We refer to this approach as grand canonical alchemical perturbation (GCAP). In this work we demonstrate GCAP for two systems; Scytalone Dehydratase (SD) and Adenosine A2A receptor. For both systems, GCAP is shown to perform well at reproducing experimental binding affinities. Calculating the relative binding affinities with a na{\"\i}ve, conventional attempt to solvate the active site illustrates how poor results can be if proper consideration of water molecules in occluded pockets is neglected. GCAP results are shown to be consistent with time-consuming double decoupling simulations. In addition, by obtaining the free energy surface for ligand perturbations, as a function of both the free energy coupling parameter and water chemical potential, it is possible to directly deconvolute the binding energetics in terms of protein\textendash ligand direct interactions and protein binding site hydration.},

  abstract = {In the recent SAMPL5 challenge, participants submitted predictions for cyclohexane/water distribution coefficients for a set of 53 small molecules. Distribution coefficients (log D) replace the hydration free energies that were a central part of the past five SAMPL challenges. A wide variety of computational methods were represented by the 76 submissions from 18 participating groups. Here, we analyze submissions by a variety of error metrics and provide details for a number of reference calculations we performed. As in the SAMPL4 challenge, we assessed the ability of participants to evaluate not just their statistical uncertainty, but their model uncertainty\textemdash how well they can predict the magnitude of their model or force field error for specific predictions. Unfortunately, this remains an area where prediction and analysis need improvement. In SAMPL4 the top performing submissions achieved a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) around 1.5 kcal/mol. If we anticipate accuracy in log D predictions to be similar to the hydration free energy predictions in SAMPL4, the expected error here would be around 1.54 log units. Only a few submissions had an RMSE below 2.5 log units in their predicted log D values. However, distribution coefficients introduced complexities not present in past SAMPL challenges, including tautomer enumeration, that are likely to be important in predicting biomolecular properties of interest to drug discovery, therefore some decrease in accuracy would be expected. Overall, the SAMPL5 distribution coefficient challenge provided great insight into the importance of modeling a variety of physical effects. We believe these types of measurements will be a promising source of data for future blind challenges, especially in view of the relatively straightforward nature of the experiments and the level of insight provided.},

Two smaller curated sets of 18 and 15 ligands were developed to test alchemical free energy methods. This overview summarizes all aspects of GC2, including the dataset details, challenge procedures, and participant results. We also consider implications for progress in the field, while highlighting methodological areas that merit continued development. Similar to GC2015, the outcome of GC2 underscores the pressing need for methods development in pose prediction, particularly for ligand scaffolds not currently represented in the Protein Data Bank (http://www.pdb.org), and in affinity ranking and scoring of bound ligands.},

The challenges for both target datasets were conducted in two stages, with the first stage testing pose predictions and the capacity to rank compounds by affinity with minimal structural data; and the second stage testing methods for ranking compounds with knowledge of at least a subset of the ligand\textendash protein poses. An additional sub-challenge provided small groups of chemically similar HSP90 compounds amenable to alchemical calculations of relative binding free energy. Unlike previous blinded Challenges, we did not provide cognate receptors or receptors prepared with hydrogens and likewise did not require a specified crystal structure to be used for pose or affinity prediction in Stage 1. Given the freedom to select from over 200 crystal structures of HSP90 in the PDB, participants employed workflows that tested not only core docking and scoring technologies, but also methods for addressing water-mediated ligand\textendash protein interactions, binding pocket flexibility, and the optimal selection of protein structures for use in docking calculations. Nearly 40 participating groups submitted over 350 prediction sets for Grand Challenge 2015.

  abstract = {The rapid growth of structural information for G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) has led to a greater understanding of their structure, function, selectivity, and ligand binding. Although novel ligands have been identified using methods such as virtual screening, computationally driven lead optimization has been possible only in isolated cases because of challenges associated with predicting binding free energies for related compounds. Here, we provide a systematic characterization of the performance of free-energy perturbation (FEP) calculations to predict relative binding free energies of congeneric ligands binding to GPCR targets using a consistent protocol and no adjustable parameters. Using the FEP+ package, first we validated the protocol, which includes a full lipid bilayer and explicit solvent, by predicting the binding affinity for a total of 45 different ligands across four different GPCRs (adenosine A2AAR, {$\beta$}1 adrenergic, CXCR4 chemokine, and {$\delta$} opioid receptors). Comparison with experimental binding affinity measurements revealed a highly predictive ranking correlation (average spearman {$\rho$} = 0.55) and low root-mean-square error (0.80 kcal/mol). Next, we applied FEP+ in a prospective project, where we predicted the affinity of novel, potent adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) antagonists. Four novel compounds were synthesized and tested in a radioligand displacement assay, yielding affinity values in the nanomolar range. The affinity of two out of the four novel ligands (plus three previously reported compounds) was correctly predicted (within 1 kcal/mol), including one compound with approximately a tenfold increase in affinity compared to the starting compound. Detailed analyses of the simulations underlying the predictions provided insights into the structural basis for the two cases where the affinity was overpredicted. Taken together, these results establish a protocol for systematically applying FEP+ to GPCRs and provide guidelines for identifying potent molecules in drug discovery lead optimization projects.},

Low molecular weight receptors and their ligands\textemdash i.e., host\textendash guest systems\textemdash represent valuable test-beds for such affinity prediction methods, because their small size makes for fast calculations and relatively facile numerical convergence. The SAMPL3 community exercise included the first ever blind prediction challenge for host\textendash guest binding affinities, through the incorporation of 11 new host\textendash guest complexes. Ten participating research groups addressed this challenge with a variety of approaches. Statistical assessment indicates that, although most methods performed well at predicting some general trends in binding affinity, overall accuracy was not high, as all the methods suffered from either poor correlation or high RMS errors or both. There was no clear advantage in using explicit versus implicit solvent models, any particular force field, or any particular approach to conformational sampling. In a few cases, predictions using very similar energy models but different sampling and/or free-energy methods resulted in significantly different results. The protonation states of one host and some guest molecules emerged as key uncertainties beyond the choice of computational approach. The present results have implications for methods development and future blind prediction exercises.},

The predictions were in poor agreement with experiment, and we conjectured that much of the error might derive from the force field, CHARMm with Vcharge charges. Repeating the calculations with other generalized force-fields led to no significant improvement, and we observed that the predicted affinities were highly sensitive to the choice of force-field. We therefore embarked on a systematic evaluation of a set of generalized force fields, based upon comparisons with PM6-DH2, a fast yet accurate semi-empirical quantum mechanics method. In particular, we compared gas-phase interaction energies and entropies for the host-guest complexes themselves, as well as for smaller chemical fragments derived from the same molecules. The mean deviations of the force field interaction energies from the quantum results were greater than 3 kcal/mol and 9 kcal/mol, for the fragments and host-guest systems respectively. We further evaluated the accuracy of force-fields for computing the vibrational entropies and found the mean errors to be greater than 4 kcal/mol. Given these errors in energy and entropy, it is not surprising in retrospect that the predicted binding affinities deviated from the experiment by several kcal/mol. These results emphasize the need for improvements in generalized force-fields and also highlight the importance of systematic evaluation of force-field parameters prior to evaluating different free-energy methods.},

  abstract = {Prospective validation of methods for computing binding affinities can help assess their predictive power and thus set reasonable expectations for their performance in drug design applications. Supramolecular host\textendash guest systems are excellent model systems for testing such affinity prediction methods, because their small size and limited conformational flexibility, relative to proteins, allows higher throughput and better numerical convergence. The SAMPL4 prediction challenge therefore included a series of host\textendash guest systems, based on two hosts, cucurbit[7]uril and octa-acid. Binding affinities in aqueous solution were measured experimentally for a total of 23 guest molecules. Participants submitted 35 sets of computational predictions for these host\textendash guest systems, based on methods ranging from simple docking, to extensive free energy simulations, to quantum mechanical calculations. Over half of the predictions provided better correlations with experiment than two simple null models, but most methods underperformed the null models in terms of root mean squared error and linear regression slope. Interestingly, the overall performance across all SAMPL4 submissions was similar to that for the prior SAMPL3 host\textendash guest challenge, although the experimentalists took steps to simplify the current challenge. While some methods performed fairly consistently across both hosts, no single approach emerged as consistent top performer, and the nonsystematic nature of the various submissions made it impossible to draw definitive conclusions regarding the best choices of energy models or sampling algorithms. Salt effects emerged as an issue in the calculation of absolute binding affinities of cucurbit[7]uril-guest systems, but were not expected to affect the relative affinities significantly. Useful directions for future rounds of the challenge might involve encouraging participants to carry out some calculations that replicate each others' studies, and to systematically explore parameter options.},

  abstract = {The ability to computationally predict protein-small molecule binding affinities with high accuracy would accelerate drug discovery and reduce its cost by eliminating rounds of trial-and-error synthesis and experimental evaluation of candidate ligands. As academic and industrial groups work toward this capability, there is an ongoing need for datasets that can be used to rigorously test new computational methods. Although protein\textendash ligand data are clearly important for this purpose, their size and complexity make it difficult to obtain well-converged results and to troubleshoot computational methods. Host\textendash guest systems offer a valuable alternative class of test cases, as they exemplify noncovalent molecular recognition but are far smaller and simpler. As a consequence, host\textendash guest systems have been part of the prior two rounds of SAMPL prediction exercises, and they also figure in the present SAMPL5 round. In addition to being blinded, and thus avoiding biases that may arise in retrospective studies, the SAMPL challenges have the merit of focusing multiple researchers on a common set of molecular systems, so that methods may be compared and ideas exchanged. The present paper provides an overview of the host\textendash guest component of SAMPL5, which centers on three different hosts, two octa-acids and a glycoluril-based molecular clip, and two different sets of guest molecules, in aqueous solution. A range of methods were applied, including electronic structure calculations with implicit solvent models; methods that combine empirical force fields with implicit solvent models; and explicit solvent free energy simulations. The most reliable methods tend to fall in the latter class, consistent with results in prior SAMPL rounds, but the level of accuracy is still below that sought for reliable computer-aided drug design. Advances in force field accuracy, modeling of protonation equilibria, electronic structure methods, and solvent models, hold promise for future improvements.},

  abstract = {The biochemical half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) is the most commonly used metric for on-target activity in lead optimization. It is used to guide lead optimization, build large-scale chemogenomics analysis, off-target activity and toxicity models based on public data. However, the use of public biochemical IC50 data is problematic, because they are assay specific and comparable only under certain conditions. For large scale analysis it is not feasible to check each data entry manually and it is very tempting to mix all available IC50 values from public database even if assay information is not reported. As previously reported for Ki database analysis, we first analyzed the types of errors, the redundancy and the variability that can be found in ChEMBL IC50 database. For assessing the variability of IC50 data independently measured in two different labs at least ten IC50 data for identical protein-ligand systems against the same target were searched in ChEMBL. As a not sufficient number of cases of this type are available, the variability of IC50 data was assessed by comparing all pairs of independent IC50 measurements on identical protein-ligand systems. The standard deviation of IC50 data is only 25\% larger than the standard deviation of Ki data, suggesting that mixing IC50 data from different assays, even not knowing assay conditions details, only adds a moderate amount of noise to the overall data. The standard deviation of public ChEMBL IC50 data, as expected, resulted greater than the standard deviation of in-house intra-laboratory/inter-day IC50 data. Augmenting mixed public IC50 data by public Ki data does not deteriorate the quality of the mixed IC50 data, if the Ki is corrected by an offset. For a broad dataset such as ChEMBL database a Ki- IC50 conversion factor of 2 was found to be the most reasonable.},

Enhancements with respect to the previous version (OPLS2.1) include the addition of off-atom charge sites to represent halogen bonding and aryl nitrogen lone pairs as well as a complete refit of peptide dihedral parameters to better model the native structure of proteins. To adequately cover medicinal chemical space, OPLS3 employs over an order of magnitude more reference data and associated parameter types relative to other commonly used small molecule force fields (e.g., MMFF and OPLS\_2005). As a consequence, OPLS3 achieves a high level of accuracy across performance benchmarks that assess small molecule conformational propensities and solvation. The newly fitted peptide dihedrals lead to significant improvements in the representation of secondary structure elements in simulated peptides and native structure stability over a number of proteins. Together, the improvements made to both the small molecule and protein force field lead to a high level of accuracy in predicting protein\textendash ligand binding measured over a wide range of targets and ligands (less than 1 kcal/mol RMS error) representing a 30\% improvement over earlier variants of the OPLS force field.},

          , 
            
              Ligand binding affinity calculations based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and non-physical (alchemical) thermodynamic cycles have shown great promise for structure-based drug design. However, their broad uptake and impact is held back by the notoriously complex setup of the calculations. Only a few tools other than the free energy perturbation approach by Schr\"odinger Inc. (referred to as FEP+) currently enable end-to-end application. Here, we present for the first time an approach based on the open-source software pmx that allows to easily set up and run alchemical calculations for diverse sets of small molecules using the GROMACS MD engine. The method relies on theoretically rigorous non-equilibrium thermodynamic integration (TI) foundations, and its flexibility allows calculations with multiple force fields. In this study, results from the Amber and Charmm force fields were combined to yield a consensus outcome performing on par with the commercial FEP+ approach. A large dataset of 482 perturbations from 13 different protein\textendash ligand datasets led to an average unsigned error (AUE) of 3.64 {$\pm$} 0.14 kJ mol
              -1
              , equivalent to Schr\"odinger's FEP+ AUE of 3.66 {$\pm$} 0.14 kJ mol
              -1
              . For the first time, a setup is presented for overall high precision and high accuracy relative protein\textendash ligand alchemical free energy calculations based on open-source software.},

          , 
            The capability to rank different potential drug molecules against a protein target for potency has always been a fundamental challenge in computational chemistry due to its importance in drug design. While several simulation-based methodologies exist, they are hard to use prospectively and thus predicting potency in lead optimization campaigns remains an open challenge. Here we present the first machine learning approach specifically tailored for ranking congeneric series based on deep 3D-convolutional neural networks. Furthermore we prove its effectiveness by blindly testing it on datasets provided by Janssen, Pfizer and Biogen totalling over 3246 ligands and 13 targets as well as several well-known openly available sets, representing one the largest evaluations ever performed. We also performed online learning simulations of lead optimization using the approach in a predictive manner obtaining significant advantage over experimental choice. We believe that the evaluation performed in this study is strong evidence of the usefulness of a modern deep learning model in lead optimization pipelines against more expensive simulation-based alternatives.},

            Alchemical free energy methods with molecular mechanics (MM) force fields are now widely used in the prioritization of small molecules for synthesis in structure-enabled drug discovery projects because of their ability to deliver 1\textendash 2 kcal mol
            -1
            accuracy in well-behaved protein-ligand systems. Surpassing this accuracy limit would significantly reduce the number of compounds that must be synthesized to achieve desired potencies and selectivities in drug design campaigns. However, MM force fields pose a challenge to achieving higher accuracy due to their inability to capture the intricate atomic interactions of the physical systems they model. A major limitation is the accuracy with which ligand intramolecular energetics\textemdash especially torsions\textemdash can be modeled, as poor modeling of torsional profiles and coupling with other valence degrees of freedom can have a significant impact on binding free energies. Here, we demonstrate how a new generation of hybrid machine learning / molecular mechanics (ML/MM) potentials can deliver significant accuracy improvements in modeling protein-ligand binding affinities. Using a nonequilibrium perturbation approach, we can correct a standard, GPU-accelerated MM alchemical free energy calculation in a simple post-processing step to efficiently recover ML/MM free energies and deliver a significant accuracy improvement with small additional computational effort. To demonstrate the utility of ML/MM free energy calculations, we apply this approach to a benchmark system for predicting kinase:inhibitor binding affinities\textemdash a congeneric ligand series for non-receptor tyrosine kinase TYK2 (Tyk2)\textemdash wherein state-of-the-art MM free energy calculations (with OPLS2.1) achieve inaccuracies of 0.93{$\pm$}0.12 kcal mol
            -1
            in predicting absolute binding free energies. Applying an ML/MM hybrid potential based on the ANI2x ML model and AMBER14SB/TIP3P with the OpenFF 1.0.0 (``Parsley'') small molecule force field as an MM model, we show that it is possible to significantly reduce the error in absolute binding free energies from 0.97 [95\% CI: 0.68, 1.21] kcal mol
            -1
            (MM) to 0.47 [95\% CI: 0.31, 0.63] kcal mol

              Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort
              1–4
              , the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined
              5
              , but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences
              6,7
              . Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’
              8
              —has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years
              9
              . Despite recent progress
              10–14
              , existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)
              15
              , demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},
